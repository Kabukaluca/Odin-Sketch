This project serves as a practice and is part of my TOP curriculum

I will be creating an Etch-a-Sketch:
    slider to choose size of sketchpad (2x2 px - 100x100 px);
    color of pen (any color or rainbow);
    clear button;
    eraser "pen"
    theme sourrounding the Etch-a-sketch pad;

I might review / update this README file after finnishing the Project;
